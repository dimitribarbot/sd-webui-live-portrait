# [LivePortrait](https://github.com/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait) for Stable Diffusion WebUI

Pickle files have all been converted to safetensors by Kijai: https://huggingface.co/Kijai/LivePortrait_safetensors/tree/main (thanks).  
Model files go here (and are automatically downloaded if the folder is not present): `stable-diffusion-webui/models/liveportrait` (human) and `stable-diffusion-webui/models/liveportrait_animals` (animals).

## Face detectors
This extension is using the original default Insightface which is strictly for NON-COMMERCIAL use.

Insightface models go here (and are automatically downloaded if the folder is not present): `stable-diffusion-webui/models/insightface/models/buffalo_l`.  
If necessary, they can be downloaded from: https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/releases/download/v0.7/buffalo_l.zip.
